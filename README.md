# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Repository

By Kevin O'Leary

This repository is my submission for the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing and Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University. 

# Contents of Repository
- This Readme file
- tasks.ipynb -a notebook containing the 5 assessments and their corresponding analysis.
- project.ipynb notebook which contains all of the research, analysis and plots formed. 
- a .gitignore file to ignore any temporary files and folders that should not normally be committed to a repository

**Tasks**

We were given 5 different tasks corresponding to a topic presented for every two weeks of lectures. 


**Project Instruction**

- Create a notebook investigating the variables and data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher.
- Discuss the classification of each variable within the data set according to common variable types and scales of measurement in  mathematics, statistics, and Python.
- Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary.
- Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for
each variable.

# How to download this repository

1. Download Anaconda.
2. Download VsCode or use JupyterNotebook via browser (https://jupyter.org/try).
3. Clone the repository from  https://github.com/Kevin002023/FODA. 
4. Open via VsCode or JupyterNotebooks.

# **Software Used**
This project was done on Jupyter Notebooks using Python 3.11.15. on the editor Visual Studio Code V 1.75.1. It was used to produce both the code and this README.md file.

The original dataset used is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

The packages I used are;

pandas as pd
matplotlib.pyplot as plt
numpy as np
seaborn as sns
shapiro from scipy.stats


# **References**

References are noted in the section in which they are used and are listed at the end of the notebook. There are some references listed which are not used directly in the notebook but which were used to gain an understanding of the topics involved.
